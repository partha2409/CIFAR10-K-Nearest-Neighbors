# CIFAR10 KNearest-Neighbors

A simple KNN classifier implementation with L1 distance metric

# Requirements
1. dask (faster version of numpy). <br>

Alternatively, if you have a GPU, use cupy library for faster computation

# Steps to run 
1. change the value of K in the nearest_neighbor.py file if required. The default is set to 1. <br>
2. Run nearest_neighbor.py
